Last interaction:

Sarah just received her December monthly bill from AT&T and noticed an unexpected charge of $50. She called AT&T’s customer service department to inquire about the charge. After waiting on hold for several minutes, she spoke with a representative who listened to her concern and reviewed her account.

The representative explained that the charges were from an in-app purchases of a game on the iPad. Sarah recognized the game as one that her children enjoy playing and noted that they must have made the purchases without her permission. The representative asked a few questions about the charges and then put Sarah on hold for a few moments. When he came back, he said that he could see she was a long-time customer and had never missed a bill. He then said that the charges would be reversed this time as a one-time courtesy.

Sarah then asked the representative if there were any current promotions or offers available that could help reduce her monthly bill. The representative provided details about a current promotion that bundled her current unlimited data plan with a TV subscription, and also offered to review Sarah's account to see if there are any other discounts or promotions that she may be eligible for. Sarah declined for the moment, saying she was happy with her current TV provider, but she appreciated the offer.

Overall, the representative was able to resolve Sarah's concern about the unexpected charge and provided her with information about new promotions. This positive interaction with AT&T customer service department helped to strengthen Sarah's loyalty to the company and left her feeling satisfied with the outcome of her call.
